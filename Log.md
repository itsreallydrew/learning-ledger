I learned how to make a game in Python. The game allowed the player to guess the 50 state capitols with a score tally running in the background and hints. I will add a copy of the game to this repo for reference.

I edited one of my older projects from class. It is a stock tracker app that I customized. The API key was only working when I was testing on local host but not when I deployed the app. I realized I needed to add the key to the netlify platform and then I was able to get the deployed version to work. Also made sure to add redirects file as that caused a problem with my last application.

I also made some slight changes to make the project more responsive. I added a media query to hide the logo when the app was smaller than a certain size.
