# learning-ledger
This purpose of this repository is to hold myself accountable and to inspire myself. I like to learn new things, but one of my shortcomings is that I don't always keep a record of what I do or have an easy way to revisit topics I may have looked into. 

By creating this ledger, I can now track everything that I do and provide myself a space to go back if I forget something or use it as a reference. I can record my accomplishments but also my failures because all of them are valuable opportunities for growth.
